Lemongrass Chicken Wings
1. Grate the white part of 2 stalks lemongrass, about 2 tablespoons. Keep the rest of the lemongrass and cut into 4-inch (10cm) length, use the back of a knife to pound and smash the lemongrass to release its aroma and flavor.
2. Rinse 750 grams of chicken wings with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. 
3. Transfer wings to a Ziploc bag and add lemongrass, 3 tablespoons of fish sauce, 5 cloves of smashed garlic, 1 tablespoon of honey and 1/4 teaspoon of cracked black pepper. Combine everything well and make sure that the wings are nicely coated with the fish sauce and lemongrass mixture. Let marinate in the fridge overnight.
4. Preheat the oven to 350F. Roast chicken wings for 20 minutes or until the surface turns brown. 
5. Broil for 1-2 minutes to char the surface.
